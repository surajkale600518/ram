<h1>shivaji-maharaj</h1>
<p>Shivaji Maharaj is one of the great national heroes of India. He created an independent and sovereign state in Maharashtra which was based on justice, welfare of the people and tolerance to all faiths. The aims, objectives and Rajnitee of the Maratha Swaraj under Chhatrapati Shivaji provided a new direction to contemporary politics of India. In course of time, his movement assumed, the form of an all-India struggle; a struggle which was to change the political map of India.

    Shivaji Maharaj was born at the Shivneri fort near Junnar in Pune district on 19th February 1630. Shivaj
    s mother, Jijabai was the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. His father Shahajiraje Bhosale was a 
    prominent sardar in the Deccan. At the time of Shivaji Maharajâ€™s birth, most of the territory in Maharashtra 
    was under the possession of the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur. In the coastal belt of Konkan
     there were two sea powers, the Portuguese and the Siddi. The British and the Dutch who were engaged in expanding
      their trade also had their factories on the coast. The Mughals, since the period of Emperor Akbar 1 wanted to expand 
      their power in the South. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the Nizamshahi Kingdom. The Adilshah of Bijapur
    allied with the Mughals in this campaign. Shahahajiraje tried to save the Nizamshahi, but he could not withstand the  
    combined might of the Mughals and the Adilshahi. The Nizamshahi kingdom came to an end in A.D. 1636. Thereafter Shahajiraje 
    became a sardar of the Adilshah of Bijapur and was posted in Karnataka. The region comprising Pune, Supe, Indapur and Chakan
    parganas located between the Bhima and Nira rivers which was vested in Shahajiraje as a jagir was continued by the Adilshah.
     Shahaijiraje was also assigned a jagir of Banglore. Veermata Jijabai and Shivajiraje, stayed for a few years with Shahajiraje
    at Banglore till Shivajiraje was twelve years old. Shahajiraje entrusted the administration of the Pune jagir to Shivajiraje  and Veermata Jijabai. Shivajiraje grew up amidst the hills
     and valleys of Pune region under the guidance of his mother Jijabai.
